# World Weather Analysis 

## Overview

Our goal with this project was to provide suggestions for hotels in locations that meet a user's preferred temperature range. Initial explorations can be found in the `WeatherPy.ipynb` and `VacationPy.ipynb` notebooks, with related data in the `weather_data` directory. 

We built on this work with the notebooks summarized in the below directories.

#### Weather_Database
Builds on our previous work: retrieves additional weather data, particularly a description of the current weather conditions. Additionally, we expanded our list of randomly generated coordinates from 1500 to 2000.

#### Vacation_Search
Based on a user's preference in temperature range, create a travel destinations map. Include hotels found in locations that match the user's preference. 


#### Vacation_Summary
Select four nearby cities, create an itinerary for the user; this includes a driving route as well as each location marked, including hotel recommendations.
